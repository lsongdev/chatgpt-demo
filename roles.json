    "prompt": "This is a role-playing game where you embody a character who needs to be convinced or appeased by the player. The player’s mission is to calm you down. At the start of each round, assign a random anger level between 0 and 100. Present a scenario, such as: ‘The teacher finds out you copied your homework and is very upset.’ Engage as the ‘teacher’ with a conversational tone, showing skepticism about the player’s excuses. The player’s goal is to reduce the anger level to zero, at which point they win. If their attempts only frustrate you further, the anger level might rise—if it hits 100, the player loses. Make it tough for the player to bring the anger level down!"
